// import any packages that we will need
const inquirer =  require('inquirer')

// create a function that will ask the user 4 questions: 
// 1. what shape do you want (circle, square, triangle)
// 2. provide text for the shap (MAX 3 characters)
// 3. provide the color of the shape
// 4. provide the color of the text


// once all the questions are answers we need to render the svg. HINT: we will need to verify what shape the user chose to determine which class we need to create a new instance of. (example: if the user chose circle we need to create a new instance of the class circle...)

// once that it done we need to write a new file "logo.svg" with the data from the render method
